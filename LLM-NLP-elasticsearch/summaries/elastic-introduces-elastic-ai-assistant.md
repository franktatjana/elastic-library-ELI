2. OpenAI gives accurate recommendations thanks to publically available elastic product information; 
2. Assistant comes with  pre-built promts for security use cases, can be extended with custom prompts for other data or use cases;
3. Assistant displays all the data that will be sent to the LLM and allows the user to redact, remove, or change it beforehand; 
4. Elastic provides relevant  context based on organization data;
5. Use natural language for cybersecurity operation tasks, e.g. alert investigation, workflow suggestion, or incident response.
