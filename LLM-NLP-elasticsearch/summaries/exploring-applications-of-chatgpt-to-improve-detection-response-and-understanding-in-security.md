# Exploring Applications of ChatGPT to Improve Detection, Response, and Understanding in Security
The [blog post](https://www.elastic.co/de/security-labs/exploring-applications-of-chatgpt-to-improve-detection-response-and-understanding) explores the applications of ChatGPT in the field of security, specifically focusing on improving detection, response, and understanding of security incidents. It discusses the potential of using ChatGPT to enhance security operations and highlights its benefits in the context of threat detection and incident response.

OpenAI announced APIs to **integrate ChatGPT and Whisper** models into apps to experiment with LLMs, e.g. to assist with security use cases.
* *Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.* https://github.com/openai/whisper

**How to put all together?**
[sample_chatgpt_security_use_case.py](https://gist.github.com/Mikaayenson/9efff700e5d799c672c6b17338d2de6a)
1. choose a number of relevant fields (more fields, more context)
2. Simple use case: ELI5 simply queries the detection engine for alerts with predefined prompts
   - Explain this  event like I'm five
   - Explain this event to my kids
   - Explain this event to my boss
   - Explain this event to the new graduate
   - Explain what happened in this event
   - Explain this event to the CISO
   - What are next investigative steps to take based on this event
3. Summarize all of the alerts for the week into a single summary for reporting
4. Alert prioritization (alert fatigue, high volume of alerts, lack of training, constrained resources, etc.)
   - Which one of these alerts should I prioritize? (in case of generic answers add the new fields to the original events, feeding more context to ChatGPT can always help get a better answer)
   - How risk scores impact the decisions and make an appropriate recommendation.

**Why it matters?**
*you can  prioritize alerts using a rules-based strategy (e.g. sort alerts by highest severity) but other factors can impact the response (volume of alerts, the similarity of alerts, etc.), where at the end of the day the recommendation may be ultimately based on a timestamp or another field provided that is not as obvious to the responder.*

---
**What are future directions?**
   - *Contextualizing alerts*: past alerts provide relevant insights to the analyst.
   - *Training new models*: applying transfer-learning techniques to train new predictive models that are tailored to an organization's specific dataset and security needs. This training would cover large sets of historical reports, logs, ELT-prepped network traffic, responses, etc.
   - *Automating all the things*: automating the mundane tasks away, sounds simple, but will challenge our ability to trust in automation.
   - *Threat modeling*: Create highly representative threat models and attacks that adversaries may exploit to reinforce and improve an organization's security posture.

---
**What are the potential applications for improving security operations?**
   - *Chatbot-assisted Incident Response* to identify and respond to security incidents in real-time, to analyze the incident and provide an appropriate and configurable response (e.g. execute response actions, recommend new queries, etc.).
   - *Threat information* to analyze threat data and generate reports for your security product to improve the mean-time to respond.
   - *Security policy chatbot** to answer security-related questions while investigating threats, provide accurate and relevant answers to questions about security policies, best practices, summarizing information, and more.
   - *Alert prioritization* to group and prioritize the most relevant information to the analyst for an expedited response.
